# ioBroker.hoymiles-ms Documentation

## Overview

The **ioBroker.hoymiles-ms** adapter integrates **Hoymiles MicroStorage systems** (currently supporting the Hoymiles MS-A2 model) into ioBroker. This adapter enables monitoring and control of your Hoymiles MS-A2 energy storage system through the ioBroker platform.

The Hoymiles MS-A2 is a MicroStorage unit that combines solar inverter and battery storage capabilities. More information about the device can be found [here](https://www.hoymiles.com/de/products/micro-storage).

**Note:** This adapter is not affiliated with Hoymiles and is an independent community project.

## Features

- **Real-time monitoring**: Battery status, power consumption, grid interaction
- **Energy tracking**: Monitor energy production, consumption, and storage
- **Grid monitoring**: Track grid-connected and off-grid operations
- **System statistics**: Comprehensive overview of system performance
- **Power control**: Set and control power output levels
- **Multiple device support**: Handle multiple MS-A2 units simultaneously
- **MQTT communication**: Reliable communication via MQTT protocol

## Prerequisites

Before setting up the adapter, ensure you have:

1. **ioBroker system** running (Node.js >= 20)
2. **Hoymiles MS-A2** MicroStorage unit
3. **S-Miles Home App** installed on your mobile device
4. **Network connectivity** between ioBroker and MS-A2 unit
5. **Free TCP port** for MQTT communication (default: 1881)

## Adapter Setup and Configuration

### Step 1: Install the Adapter

Install the adapter through the ioBroker admin interface:

1. Open the ioBroker admin interface in your web browser
2. Navigate to the "Adapters" tab
3. Search for "hoymiles-ms" in the adapter repository
4. Click the "Install" button next to the adapter

**Important:** Never install ioBroker adapters using npm directly. Always use the ioBroker admin interface for proper installation and dependency management.

### Step 2: Configure the Adapter

1. Open the ioBroker admin interface
2. Navigate to "Adapters" and find "hoymiles-ms"
3. Click on the configuration (gear) icon
4. Configure the following settings:

#### MQTT Server Configuration

| Parameter | Description | Default Value | Notes |
|-----------|-------------|---------------|-------|
| **Client Mode** | Enable MQTT client mode | `false` | Currently not implemented |
| **MQTT Network** | Network interface to bind to | `0.0.0.0` | Listen on all interfaces |
| **MQTT Port** | TCP port for MQTT server | `1881` | Avoid conflicts with other MQTT services |

**Important Notes:**
- The adapter currently operates only in **MQTT server mode**
- **Authentication is not yet supported** - ensure your network is secure
- Port 1881 is chosen to avoid conflicts with ioBroker.mqtt (1883) and ioBroker.shelly (1882)

### Step 3: Save and Start the Adapter

1. Click "Save & Close" in the configuration dialog
2. Enable the adapter instance
3. The adapter will start and begin listening for MQTT connections

## Hoymiles MS-A2 Device Setup

To connect your MS-A2 unit to the ioBroker adapter, you need to configure it using the S-Miles Home App.

### Step 1: Open S-Miles Home App

1. Launch the S-Miles Home App on your mobile device
2. Ensure you're connected to the same network as your MS-A2 unit

### Step 2: Access MQTT Configuration

1. Navigate to the **Configuration** page (gear icon in upper right corner)
2. Scroll down to find the **"MQTT-Service"** section
3. **Enable** the MQTT Service

### Step 3: Configure MQTT Settings

| Setting | Value | Description |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| **Server Address** | `<ioBroker-IP>` | IP address of your ioBroker system |
| **Port** | `1881` | Port configured in the adapter (default: 1881) |
| **Client Prefix** | `MSA` | Optional identifier prefix (default: MSA) |
| **Authentication** | `Disabled` | Must be disabled (not yet supported) |

**Example Configuration:**
- Server Address: `192.168.1.100` (replace with your ioBroker IP)
- Port: `1881`
- Client Prefix: `MSA`
- Username: *(leave empty)*
- Password: *(leave empty)*

### Step 4: Apply Settings

1. Save the MQTT configuration in the S-Miles Home App
2. The MS-A2 unit will restart its MQTT service
3. Check the ioBroker logs for connection confirmation

## Operation and Data Flow

### Data Update Intervals

The MS-A2 unit sends data at different intervals (these are defined by the Hoymiles API and cannot be configured):

- **Configuration data**: Sent once upon connection establishment
- **Real-time data**: Updated every **1 second**
- **System statistics**: Updated every **5 minutes**

### Device Connection Status

- The adapter monitors device connectivity automatically
- Devices are considered **offline** if no data is received for 30 seconds
- Connection status is displayed in the `info.online` state

## States Created by the Adapter

The adapter dynamically creates states based on the data received from your MS-A2 unit. States are organized in a hierarchical structure:

## Power Control Functionality

The adapter provides power control capabilities through specific writable states:

### Setting Power Output

To control the power output of your MS-A2 unit:

1. **Set EMS Mode**: First set `ems_mode.command` to `mqtt_ctrl`
2. **Set Power Level**: Write desired power value to `power_ctrl.set`
3. **Valid Range**: Power value must be between `power_ctrl.min` and `power_ctrl.max`
4. **Step Size**: Use `power_ctrl.step` for appropriate increments

### Example Power Control

```javascript
// Enable MQTT control mode
setState('hoymiles-ms.0.MSA_12345.ems_mode.command', 'mqtt_ctrl');

// Set power output to 500W (example)
setState('hoymiles-ms.0.MSA_12345.power_ctrl.set', 500);
```

### Power Control Notes

- Power control is only available when the device is in `mqtt_ctrl` mode
- Power settings are applied immediately by the MS-A2 unit
- Monitor the real-time states to verify power changes
- Return to `general` mode to restore automatic operation

## Multiple Device Support

The adapter automatically handles multiple MS-A2 units:

- Each device is identified by its unique client ID
- States are created dynamically for each connected device
- Device objects are organized under separate folders
- Online status is tracked individually for each device

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Device Not Connecting:**
1. Verify network connectivity between ioBroker and MS-A2
2. Check MQTT server configuration in adapter settings
3. Ensure port 1881 is not blocked by firewall
4. Verify MQTT settings in S-Miles Home App

**States Not Updating:**
1. Check device online status (`info.online`)
2. Verify timestamp updates (`info.timestamp`)
3. Check adapter logs for error messages
4. Restart adapter if necessary

**Power Control Not Working:**
1. Ensure EMS mode is set to `mqtt_ctrl`
2. Verify power value is within min/max range
3. Check that device is online and responding
4. Monitor real-time states for changes

### Log Analysis

Enable detailed logging by setting the adapter log level to "debug" or "silly":

- **Info level**: Connection events and basic operations
- **Debug level**: Detailed MQTT communication
- **Silly level**: All MQTT messages and state updates

### Network Requirements

- **Port 1881/TCP**: Must be accessible from MS-A2 to ioBroker
- **Firewall**: Ensure MQTT traffic is allowed
- **Network stability**: Stable connection required for reliable operation

## FAQ

**Q: Can I use a different MQTT port?**
A: Yes, configure any free port in the adapter settings and update the MS-A2 configuration accordingly.

**Q: Does the adapter support authentication?**
A: Not yet. Authentication support is planned for future releases.

**Q: Can I monitor multiple MS-A2 units?**
A: Yes, each unit will appear as a separate device with its own states.

**Q: How often is data updated?**
A: Real-time data updates every second, system statistics every 5 minutes (controlled by Hoymiles API).

**Q: Can I control charge/discharge schedules?**
A: Currently, only power output control is supported. Advanced scheduling may be added in future versions.

**Q: What happens if the network connection is lost?**
A: The adapter will detect offline devices and mark them accordingly. Data will resume when connection is restored.

**Q: Are there any limitations?**
A: The adapter is currently limited to read-only monitoring and basic power control. Advanced features depend on Hoymiles API capabilities.
